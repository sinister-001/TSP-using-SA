# TSP-using-SA

In my previous repository, I have written a code to solve *Binary KnapSack problem* using **Simulated Annealing** as a part of *Heuristic Search Method*. Now in this repository I am submitting the code to solve **Travelling Salesman Problem** using *Simulated Annealing*.

**What is Travelling Salesman Problem?**

Given a number of cities, a salesman should cover all the cities only once and should return to the initial point with minimum cost of travelling. This is one of the **NP-Complete** problems i.e., which can't be computed in polynomial time. In this code I assumed number of cities to be *15* and also made some plots for **all possible paths**, **optimization done by SA Algorithm** and **best final tour** to cover all the 15 cities.
